# Clever Coins: The Hackathon Project That Was Smart Enough to Quit Early

## Overview
Welcome to Clever Coins, the brainchild of a team that had dreams of revolutionizing personal finance for the youth but quickly learned the hard lessons of reality - and boy, did we learn them!

## What Was the Problem?
- **Financial Illiteracy:** Young adults are about as familiar with finance as they are with ancient Sumerian cuneiform.
- **Savings Goal:** The idea was to help them save, but instead, we might've just shown them how to sign up for things.

## Our 'Solution'
- **Savings Goals:** Users could set goals, but that's about where our innovation ended.
- **The Investment 'Algorithm':** We envisioned a sophisticated algorithm to invest users' money wisely, but ended up with a placeholder that said, "Investment in progress."

## Features We Promised But Delivered in Spirit
1. **Savings Tracker:** 
   - A beautiful start page with a login button. If you could log in, you were already ahead of the game.
2. **Friend Borrowing:** 
   - A text field where you could type "Borrow from friends". We figured if you were tech-savvy enough to use our app, you could call your friends yourself.
3. **Investment Simulator:** 
   - We had code for a button that would've taken you to a simulator, had we, you know, built one.
4. **Learning Modules:** 
   - A link to Wikipedia's page on "Economics". You're welcome for the deep dive.
5. **Risk & Reward:** 
   - The risk was downloading our app. The reward? Well, that's still under development.

## Contribute
Fork the repo, laugh at our attempt, and maybe, just maybe, add that investment algorithm we never figured out.

## License
Under the "We Tried" License - use it, laugh at it, improve upon it. Or just remember us as the team that made you appreciate real financial apps.

We didn't make it to Round 2, but hey, we made it to the end of this README. That's something, right?
